= CloudWatch Publisher

The CloudWatch publisher sends metrics to the CloudWatch account corresponding to
the credentials set up in the configurable fields. The namespace used for the publisher
should be unique to each Mule intance to avoid receiving metrics from different Mule
instances only to have them grouped together.
